# caldera
Caldera is a software to control an oil boiler Gavina (Roca) machine.
Initially there are two versions:
  0.- The 0.xx versions are running on an Arduino Nano. It works like the original electronics
  1.- The 1.xx versions are running on an ESP32. It works connected to MQTT and so on.

Let me know anything that could be added. 
v0 has a very confusing code as it was developed from scratch very quickly and only "for me" so not a code with any order.
v1 was a bit of the same, but then it comes to my mind to share this project, so I added a litle bit more organization, separated some things in different files, made some more functions... added a bit of security (if some sensor fails, for example), etc.
Any way, this is a very earlier software, and my mind is to develop it a bit more to be able to control other kind of boilers, or have more functions. Any help on this would be appreciated.
